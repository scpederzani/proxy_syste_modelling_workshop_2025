## Gridded climate data
In your projects you can use several types of climate data inputs, often from gridded products. Data that I have used frequently up to now are:

- [GridMET](https://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html) gridded interpolation of station meterological data, ~4km spatial resolution, daily data 1979-yesterday (updated daily)
- [Livneh](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/livneh-gridded-precipitation-and-other-meteorological-variables-continental-us-mexico) gridded precipitation amount data, ~6km spatial resolution, daily data 1979-2015
- [Era5-Land](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=overview) reanalysis data, includes a large number of variables beyond meteorological observations, ~9km resolution, hourly data 1950-present
